# STATUS — real-data droplet pipeline and Taguchi study

**Last updated: 2026-10-07 (Mac, after the 9x3 analysis).** This is the live state of the work. Claude keeps it current
(see "How this file is maintained" at the bottom). History, evidence and full reasoning are in
`docs/archive/HANDOFF_real_data_pipeline_LEGACY.md` (frozen 2026-10-07, newest section first).

## The goal, in one paragraph

A defined, reproducible measurement of effervescent silicone atomisation from shadowgraph video
that can **rank runs in a Taguchi parameter study** (PhD, high-definition silicone printing). The
ML model exists to make that measurement more accurate; it is not the goal. Do not drift into
process diagnosis or model-building for its own sake.

## Where we are right now

- **27 replicate runs (9 conditions x 3 repeats, captured 2026-10-05) are measured (2.1.0) and
  analysed** (2026-10-07, Mac, 63 s). Output: `/Volumes/LaCie/Experiments/Taguchi/9x3 Taguchi Repeats/`
  (`taguchi_report.md`, `taguchi_analysis.xlsx`, `figures/`, `csv/`, `odd/`). Error term = pure
  error, 18 dof.
- **Atomised fraction:** gas flow dominates (89%; 5.2 / 13.6 / 16.9 % at 3000 / 6000 / 9000 sccm).
  Silicone (4000 sps best) and RPM (300 best) small but significant. Lack of fit p = 0.020
  (interactions real but 0.6% of variation). Same picture as the first L9, RPM now resolved.
- **D32:** all three factors significant now that replicates exist: RPM 47.5% (81.4 / 85.0 / 86.7 um
  at 300 / 600 / 900), gas 21% (6000 best), silicone 15% (4000 best). Total spread ~5 um on ~84
  (~6%); pure-error SD 1.5 um. Robust to enforcing the 200 um ceiling (checked 2026-10-07,
  read-only: same ranking and significance, D32 ~2 um lower).
- **Caveat found in review: RPM is fully confounded with time of day.** Conditions were run in
  order T1..T9 with replicates back-to-back, so 300 rpm = 09:04-10:46, 600 = 10:55-11:55,
  900 = 12:02-12:57. Back-to-back replicates also make pure error a repeatability estimate, so
  p-values are optimistic. The 10/01 L9 had the same order. **Checked 2026-10-07:** fluid is
  single-part EcoFlex 00-30 (no curing), lab held 25 degC, and the per-run `background_median.tiff`
  shows no drift in illumination or window dirt across the day (r = +0.07 with time). D32 moves in
  steps at the RPM changes, not as a gradual drift, and within the 300 rpm block (1 h 40) it tracks
  gas only. So RPM is now the likeliest explanation, but only a randomised test can rule out
  mechanical drift.

## Next steps, in order

1. **RPM confirmation test** (Ben, lower urgency now): one gas/silicone setting, RPM alternated
   300/900/300/900... in one session (4-6 runs). Randomise run order in every future campaign.
2. **2.2.0 comparison** (Ben's plan): implement the fill_ratio / extinction_conc reclassification
   rule behind a flag with `SIZER_VERSION = "2.2.0"`, re-measure all 27 ("Re-measure only",
   ~1 h), analyse into a **separate** output folder, compare D32 factor significance and ranking.
   Only D32 can move. A gas-flow effect that appears only under the rule is suspect (the rule
   tracks spray density). **Before re-measuring:** back up `droplets_0.30/` and `liquid_0.30/`
   per run (~30 MB each; re-measure overwrites them in place) and expect stale extreme-frame PNGs.
3. **Fix the app bugs below before the next overnight batch** (1 and 2 at least).
4. **Fold in the Windows timings**: `9x3 Taguchi Repeats/_job/eta_calibration.json` +
   `_job/timings.csv` -> replace `eta.PRIORS_BY_OS["Windows"]` in `eta.py` with measured
   lo/typ/hi per stage. ~10 min, any time.
5. **Hardware:** powered USB 3 hub for the LaCie on the home PC (also the diagnostic: still drops
   on the hub -> cable or drive).

## Open questions that block or bias results

- **RPM vs time of day** (see "Where we are"). Also worth knowing: whether the EcoFlex 00-30 was
  mixed (curing, so viscosity rises through its pot life) or a single part, and lab temperature.

- **Which edge is "true" diameter.** Half-max (what the sizer implements) reads ~30-35% smaller
  in diameter than Ben's free-hand eye (51 droplets, 2026-10-02). The sizer is a correct
  implementation of a convention whose correctness is unsettled. Only a **calibration target**
  (reticle / graticule / glass beads) on this rig settles it. Relative ranking across Taguchi runs
  is unaffected; absolute diameters are.
- **Reclassification rule** is disqualified for Taguchi frames (tracks density, not focus:
  1 false reject / 20 false keeps on L9 frames, opposite error on the benchmark). The 9000 sccm
  hand-labelling that would settle it has not been done.
- **Decorrelation time (~20 ms) is inferred, not measured**, and the stride default rests on it.
  Measurable from any stride-1 capture (adjacent-frame cross-correlation).
- **Old L9 (10/01) is sizer 2.0.0** and not directly comparable to the 27 runs on atomised
  fraction. Re-measuring it is ~41 s/run if ever needed.

## Known bugs, not fixed

Taguchi_Analysis_UI (found in the 2026-10-06 batch):
1. One failed log write (`worker.py:229`, `OSError: [Errno 22]` on a USB drop) kills the worker.
   It should survive, wait for the drive, retry the run once.
2. A worker crash writes `job_end status: halted`, which `batch_controller.py:243` reports as a
   contract violation with no Resume. Workaround: Run batch with "Use their existing results".
3. The SELECTED RUNS summary ("N already measured") does not update while a batch runs.
4. After a crash the "already have results" dropdown showed "Re-measure only"; check the default
   (run sheet says "Use their existing results").
5. 17 Windows-only test failures, all test-side (path separators, `os.getpgid`, symlinks needing
   admin, `?` in a fake run name, one GLR test). Self-test says READY regardless.

Elsewhere:
- **Static specks detected as droplets.** The same ~5 places (e.g. x1824 y648, x336 y852,
  x1416 y108, x918 y1128) are detected as 40-60 um in-focus droplets in 20-70% of frames, in every
  run of 10/05: dirt on the window or sensor, not spray. Small, so D32 is barely affected (pulled
  slightly down); droplets per frame is inflated by a few per frame, relatively most at 3000 sccm
  (~34/frame). No trend with time. Fix later by rejecting detections that sit on static dark
  features of `background_median.tiff`. Found 2026-10-07 (scratch script, read-only).
- `measure_run.py`'s model-only atomised fraction and `score_v2.py` double-count cross-class mask
  overlap in the denominator. The quoted (classical) fraction is structurally immune.
- `master_log.xlsx`: one row saved during the GLR-column bug (after 09:04, 2026-10-05) has
  "NO DATA AVAILABLE" in Notes and graphs in O/P. Real notes are in that run's `run_summary.xlsx`.
  Scripted repair offered, not done. Close Excel first.
- `GUI_Clean.py` still creates `Brightest_Frame` (concept retired 2026-09-27).
- `score_v2.py` is model-agnostic despite its name; rename to `score_predictions.py` some time.
- `requirements.txt` is stale (lists customtkinter, not PySide6 / torch / detectron2).
- Several `__pycache__/*.pyc` files are tracked in git despite `.gitignore`; they churn across
  machines.

## The measurement currently in force (sizer 2.1.0)

- Model: v3 "Eden" (`training_2026_09_25_15_20_37`, iter 19000), tiled inference at native scale,
  score threshold 0.30, stride 10, extremes-only images.
- **D32** = in-focus droplets only (`t_min <= 0.70` focus gate, interior-pixel robust core
  estimator), half-max sizing at/above the **40 um** split, model mask below it. From
  `measure_run.py` -> `droplets_0.30/summary.json`.
- **Atomised fraction (quoted)** = `liquid_0.30/classical_summary.json` `atomised_pct_pooled`:
  half-max droplet numerator over a classically segmented whole-frame liquid denominator
  (`classical_liquid.py`). `summary.json` `atomised_pct` is model-only, reference only.
- Folder names: `droplets_<thr>` / `liquid_<thr>` (readers also accept the old
  `measurement_` / `classical_`).
- Mixed `sizer_version` is refused by the analysis, by design.

## Campaigns and where the data is

| what | where |
|---|---|
| 27 replicate runs (2026-10-05) | `/Volumes/LaCie/Experiments/2026/10/05/<run>/shadowgraph/analysis/` |
| their Taguchi output | `/Volumes/LaCie/Experiments/Taguchi/9x3 Taguchi Repeats/` |
| first L9 (2026-10-01), 2.0.0 | runs in `Experiments/2026/10/01/`; re-analysis in `Experiments/Taguchi/First Taguchi Trial (RPM, SCCM, Silicone Flow)/` (Ben calls it "Taguchi First Trial") |
| 20-frame validation set | `/Volumes/LaCie/Experiments/Real_Data/06_validation/` (never trained on) |
| free-hand sizing set (51 droplets) | `/Volumes/LaCie/Experiments/Real_Data/07_validation_taguchi/` |
| pipeline code | `AI/Real_Data_Code/` (`measure_run.py`, `classical_liquid.py`, `batch_runs.py`, ...) |
| Taguchi app | `src/ai/Taguchi_Analysis_UI/` (plan: `docs/TAGUCHI_ANALYSIS_UI_PLAN.md`; Windows run sheet: `docs/TAGUCHI_WINDOWS_RUN_SHEET.md`) |

Factors in the 27-run design: gas flow 3000/6000/9000 sccm, bubbler 300/600/900 rpm, silicone
4000/6000/8000 sps; orifice 1.2 mm, bubbler height 1. GLR is a covariate, not a factor.

## Machines

| machine | role | Python |
|---|---|---|
| Mac | analysis, development | `/Users/benschofield/anaconda3/envs/phantom/bin/python3` (no torch/detectron2) |
| home PC (BENS-PC, RTX 5060 Ti) | batches, training. LaCie = `D:` | `C:\Users\BenSc\anaconda3\envs\Detectron\python.exe` only (system 3.11 torch can't run sm_120) |
| lab PC | capture rig | system Python 3.11 (`AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311`) |

**LaCie on the home PC drops off USB** (3 times on 2026-10-06; hardware, not load-correlated).
exFAT has no journal: eject before unplugging; after any disconnect sound run Scan and repair
before using it.

## Settled — do not re-derive

Full statements and reasoning in the legacy handoff ("Established facts", "Decisions already
made", "Bit depth", and the dated sections).
- 10 um/px (100 px/mm), already calibrated. Frames are 12-bit stored as uint16.
- Classes in the model: droplet / blob / filament. Droplet size ceiling 200 um.
- Primary response: area-weighted atomised fraction (larger is better). Secondary: D32 of
  droplets (smaller is better). Count-based ratios rejected.
- Training data by compositing real objects, multiplicatively in transmission. 800x800 crops,
  tiled inference, never resize at inference.
- Gas density default 1.184 kg/m3 (air at 25 degC, matching the Alicat's STP), not 1.293.
- Capture: exposure 4 us; 190 fps avoids aliasing with the bubbler at stride 10. Shorter captures
  than the suggested 25 s are deliberate (the rig can't sustain it at high flow): don't "correct".
- Focus rejection beyond the t_min gate is deliberately deferred: analyse as-is first.

## Standing rules

- Never modify raw data. Analysis code and outputs go in their own folders; one config per study.
- Phase-gated: do the phase asked for, then STOP and report. Report findings that change the plan.
- State every assumption explicitly in reports. "Not significant" is never "no effect".
- Give Ben exact paste-able commands with absolute paths and the real interpreter.

## How this file is maintained

- Claude reads this file at the start of any work on this part of the project.
- **Claude updates it before finishing any task that changes the state**: a step done, a result
  obtained, a bug found or fixed, a decision made, a plan changed. Edit the sections in place;
  don't append a diary. Bump "Last updated" with date and machine.
- Long evidence (tables, investigations, timing breakdowns) goes in a dated note under
  `docs/notes/` or in the relevant plan doc, with a one-line pointer here. Keep this file short
  enough to read in one go (aim under ~250 lines).
- Nothing is deleted from history: the legacy handoff stays frozen, and git keeps every version
  of this file.
